# Find duplicate files
Search and create links when files are duplicated in the specified folder.

This is the first program I wrote.
Simply specify the path to a folder, and the program will search for and replace/rename (depending on the options chosen) the files that are duplicated.
It does not compare files by name but by checksum.

The python libraries (python2.7) that must be installed are: bone, stat, hashlib, sample, virtual_memory, Tkinter, tkMessageBox, tkFileDialog, PIL (pip install pillow), sys.
